## Build/Run the TTYD app

To build/run the app you just need to use the docker file on the root of repo, use it each time you do a change on the project.

```bash
# Build
docker build -t ttyd  -f manual.build.dockerfile .
# Run
docker run --rm -p 7681:7681 -it ttyd
```

## Frontend Development

To do change on the frontend side, you need to work on '/html' directory which is a react app.

```bash
# install dependencies
yarn

# Run
yarn run

# Build
yarn build
```
